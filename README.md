# Book Search Engine 

## User Story 

AS AN avid reader<br>
I WANT to search for new books to read<br>
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase<br>


## Description: 
The application has login/logout/create profile functionality. It allows the user, once they have <br> logged in, to search books and add them to a list, which they can find under "See Your Books",<br> as demonstrated in the picture below. Once the book has been read or is no longer desired, the user<br> can remove it from their list.
